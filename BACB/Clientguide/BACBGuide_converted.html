    <ul>
      <li>If the candidate is being admitted, do not allow the candidate to begin testing.</li>
      <li>If the candidate is in the testing room, put the exam in unscheduled break mode and escort the candidate from the testing room.</li>
      <li>If the candidate is taking an unscheduled break, do not let the candidate back into the testing room.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Inform the candidate of the following:
    <ul>
      <li>They cannot continue testing because they have violated a policy. (Explain which policy they violated, but do not use the words "cheating" or "misconduct.")</li>

<h3 id="66-technical-issues">6.6 Technical issues</h3>
<p><strong>How should TAs handle technical issues?</strong><br>Follow the standard process. Please note the scenarios below:</p>

<h4>Unscheduled Break Issue (Blue Screen)</h4>
<p>Occasionally, a blue screen might appear when you put an exam in unscheduled break mode or when a candidate returns from an unscheduled break. If this occurs, you cannot resume the exam or log back in to Delivery Manager.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Before you call VSS, reboot the delivery workstation. When you reboot the workstation, the exam clock stops so that candidates do not lose more time.</li>
  <li>Log in to Delivery Manager and try to resume the exam. If the exam resumes, skip to step 4.</li>
  <li>If the exam will not resume after rebooting the workstation, call VSS. VSS will help troubleshoot the issue, but they will not add more time to the exam because the exam clock stops when you reboot the workstation.</li>
  <li>Create a case, selecting "Exam delivery" and "Problem with Pearson VUE application."</li>
</ol>

<h4>Internet Connection Issues</h4>
<p>All BACB exams require an internet connection, so internet outages and slowdowns may affect the exams. Occasionally, an exam may take a minute or two to load when first launched or when a candidate returns from an unscheduled break. Please give each exam a few minutes to load before contacting VSS or restarting the exam. Pressing Ctrl+R on the keyboard to refresh the browser page will resolve most issues triggered by network latency or spikes in server traffic.</p>
<p>Always create a case if a candidate experiences connection issues, even if the issues are resolved without contacting VSS or restarting the exam. When you create the case, select "Exam Delivery" and "Problem with Pearson VUE application."</p>
