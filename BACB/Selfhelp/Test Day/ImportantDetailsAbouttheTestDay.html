<h2 id="before-the-test">Before the test</h2>
<p>It is important to arrive at the test center at least <strong>30 minutes</strong> before your scheduled appointment time to allow enough time for check-in procedures. Pearson VUE wants you to have the best testing experience possible. On exam day, give yourself enough time to get to the test center.</p>
<p>Be sure to review your <strong>Authorization to Test (ATT)</strong> email for specific instructions about your test day.</p>

<h2 id="what-do-i-need-to-bring">What do I need to bring?</h2>
<p>On the day of the test, you must bring the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Two forms of identification</strong> (ID) — one primary and one secondary:
    <ul>
      <li>The <strong>primary ID</strong> must be a government-issued ID with a photograph and signature (e.g., driver’s license, passport).</li>
      <li>The <strong>secondary ID</strong> must also include a signature (e.g., Social Security card, bank card, employee ID).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure that both IDs are valid and not expired.</p>

<h2 id="required-identification">Required identification</h2>
<h3>Primary ID:</h3>
<p>Your primary ID must meet these criteria:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Government-issued</li>
  <li>Unexpired</li>
  <li>Contain both a photograph and a signature</li>
</ul>
<p>Accepted forms of primary ID include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Driver's license</li>
  <li>Passport</li>
  <li>Military ID</li>
  <li>Alien registration card (green card)</li>
  <li>State or country ID card</li>
</ul>

<h3>Secondary ID:</h3>
<p>Your secondary ID must also be unexpired and include a signature. Examples of secondary ID include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Social Security card</li>
  <li>Bank card</li>
  <li>Employee ID</li>
  <li>Library card</li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure that both your primary and secondary IDs match the name on your registration.</p>

<h2 id="test-center-directions">Test center directions</h2>
<p>You can find detailed directions to your test center location in the <strong>confirmation email</strong> from Pearson VUE or by logging into your Pearson VUE account. Make sure to plan your route ahead of time and account for possible traffic or public transportation delays.</p>

<h2 id="day-of-test-emergencies">Day-of-test emergencies</h2>
<p>If you encounter an emergency that prevents you from attending the test, contact the <strong>BACB</strong> through their <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.bacb.com/appeals/administrative-appeals/">Administrative Appeals</a> page immediately. The BACB may allow you to reschedule the test depending on the nature of the emergency. Emergencies reported less than <strong>48 hours</strong> before the exam may not qualify for rescheduling, so it is important to notify BACB as soon as possible.</p>
