## Scheduling a test

To schedule a BACB exam, you must first submit a certification application to the BACB (Behavior Analyst Certification Board) and receive an Authorization to Test (ATT) email. Once the ATT is received, you can schedule and pay for your exam either through the Pearson VUE website or by contacting Pearson VUE Customer Service.

- **Age requirement:** You must be at least 18 years old to test.
- **Appointment requirement:** BACB exams are only available by appointment; walk-in appointments are not allowed.

If you require special accommodations, BACB must approve the accommodation before you can schedule the exam.

## Rescheduling and canceling

If you need to change your appointment, you can either reschedule or cancel it through the Pearson VUE website or by contacting Pearson VUE Customer Service. Test centers cannot directly reschedule or cancel appointments. All changes must be made at least **48 hours** before your scheduled test. If you miss this window, you may not be able to reschedule or cancel without incurring additional fees.

### Fees for rescheduling or canceling:

- **More than 30 days before the appointment:** No fee for rescheduling or canceling.
- **5 to 30 days before the appointment:** A fee applies for both rescheduling and canceling:
    - 1.5-hour exam: $27.00
    - 4-hour exam: $59.00
- **2 to 5 days before the appointment:** A higher fee applies for both rescheduling and canceling:
    - 1.5-hour exam: $32.00
    - 4-hour exam: $69.00
- **Less than 48 hours:** Rescheduling or canceling is not permitted. Your appointment will be considered a "no-show" and you will forfeit your exam fee.

If you need to reschedule or cancel due to an emergency within 48 hours of your appointment, contact BACB directly through their [Administrative Appeals](https://www.bacb.com/appeals/administrative-appeals/) process for further assistance.

## Rescheduling and canceling with accommodations

If your exam includes special accommodations, you must wait until your accommodation request is approved by BACB before making any changes to your appointment. Once approved, the same rescheduling and canceling rules apply. Be sure to allow at least **48 hours** for any changes.

## What if I'm past the deadline to reschedule or cancel my test?

If you miss the 48-hour deadline to reschedule or cancel your test, your exam will be marked as a "no-show," and you will lose your exam fee. To take the test, you will need to purchase the exam again and schedule a new appointment. In emergencies, contact BACB for assistance through their [Administrative Appeals](https://www.bacb.com/appeals/administrative-appeals/) page.

## Change test delivery (Test Center)

BACB exams are only administered at Pearson VUE test centers, as online testing is not available. To change your test center location, you must cancel your current appointment and schedule a new one using the Pearson VUE website or Customer Service.

## Change test language

If you need to change the language in which you take the exam, you must cancel your current appointment and schedule a new one with the desired language through the Pearson VUE website or Customer Service.

## Retaking a test

If you need to retake the exam, you must contact BACB to reapply. BACB will then send a new Authorization to Test (ATT) email to you, allowing you to schedule a new exam through Pearson VUE. Keep in mind, you cannot retake an exam you have already passed unless your certification has expired.
