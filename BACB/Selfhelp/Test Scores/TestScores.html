<h2 id="when-will-i-get-my-score-report">When will I get my score report?</h2>
<p>You will receive an official score report immediately after completing the exam at the test center. This report will include your overall score and indicate whether you passed or failed the exam.</p>
<p>For most BACB exams, your score report is available in both print and electronic formats on the same day. However, for paper-based exams, it may take longer to receive your official results.</p>

<h2 id="view-your-score-report-online">View your score report online</h2>
<p>You can access your score report online by logging into your Pearson VUE account. In most cases, the score report will be available within an hour after completing your exam. To view your scores:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Log in to your <a href="https://home.pearsonvue.com/bacb" target="_blank">Pearson VUE account</a>.</li>
  <li>Select the exam for which you want to view the score.</li>
  <li>Download and review your score report.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you have trouble accessing your score report, contact Pearson VUE Customer Service for assistance.</p>

<h2 id="copy-of-score-report">Copy of score report</h2>
<p>If you need a physical copy of your score report, you can request a printed copy at the test center after you complete the exam. Additionally, you can print your score report from your online Pearson VUE account at any time.</p>
<p>It is recommended to keep a copy of your score report for your records, as it will be required when applying for certification or licensure.</p>

<h2 id="can-i-challenge-my-score-report">Can I challenge my score report?</h2>
<p>BACB does not allow you to challenge or appeal your exam scores. All scores are final once released. If you fail the exam and wish to retake it, you must contact BACB to reapply and receive a new Authorization to Test (ATT) before scheduling a new exam.</p>
