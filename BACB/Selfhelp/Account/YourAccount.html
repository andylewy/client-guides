<h2 id="create-an-account">Create an account</h2>
<p>To take a BACB exam, you must first create an account with Pearson VUE. You can do this by visiting the <a href="https://home.pearsonvue.com/bacb" target="_blank">Pearson VUE BACB portal</a> and following the registration steps.</p>
<p>When creating your account, be sure to provide accurate personal information, including your name as it appears on your identification documents, as this will be verified on the day of the exam.</p>

<h2 id="account-login">Account login</h2>
<p>Once you have created your Pearson VUE account, you can log in to schedule exams, view appointments, and access your score reports. To log in, go to the <a href="https://home.pearsonvue.com/bacb" target="_blank">Pearson VUE BACB portal</a> and use the credentials you created during the registration process.</p>
<p>If you forget your login details, you can reset your password using the "Forgot password" option on the login page.</p>

<h2 id="update-account">Update account</h2>
<p>If you need to update any personal information, such as your name, address, or contact details, you must contact the BACB directly through their <a href="https://www.bacb.com/contact-us/" target="_blank">Contact Us</a> page. Pearson VUE is not authorized to make changes to your personal information once your account has been created.</p>
<p>Ensure that your account information is up to date before your exam to avoid any complications on test day.</p>
