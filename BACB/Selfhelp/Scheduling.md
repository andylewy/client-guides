## Scheduling a Test

To schedule a BACB exam, candidates must first submit a certification application to the BACB (Behavior Analyst Certification Board) and receive an Authorization to Test (ATT) email. Once the ATT is received, candidates can schedule and pay for their exam either through the Pearson VUE website or by contacting Pearson VUE Customer Service.

- **Age requirement:** Candidates must be at least 18 years old to test.
- **Appointment requirement:** BACB exams are only available by appointment; walk-in appointments are not allowed.

Make sure to schedule your test at least 24 hours in advance. If you require special accommodations, BACB must approve the accommodation before you can schedule the exam.

## What if I'm Past the Deadline to Reschedule or Cancel My Test?

If you miss the 48-hour deadline to reschedule or cancel your test, your exam will be marked as a "no-show," and you will lose your exam fee. To take the test, you will need to purchase the exam again and schedule a new appointment. In emergencies, contact BACB for assistance through their **Administrative Appeals** page.

## Change Test Delivery (Test Center)

BACB exams are only administered at Pearson VUE test centers, as online testing is not available. To change your test center location, you must cancel your current appointment and schedule a new one using the Pearson VUE website or Customer Service.

## Change Test Language

If you need to change the language in which you take the exam, you must cancel your current appointment and schedule a new one with the desired language through the Pearson VUE website or Customer Service.

## Retaking a Test

If you need to retake the exam, you must contact BACB to reapply. BACB will then send a new Authorization to Test (ATT) email to you, allowing you to schedule a new exam through Pearson VUE. Keep in mind, you cannot retake an exam you have already passed unless your certification has expired.
