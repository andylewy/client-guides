<h2 id="what-forms-of-payment-can-i-use">What forms of payment can I use?</h2>
<p>Pearson VUE collects payments on behalf of the BACB for all exam-related fees. The following payment methods are accepted:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Credit and debit cards:</strong> All major credit and debit cards are accepted.</li>
  <li><strong>Vouchers:</strong> Vouchers can be purchased from the Pearson VUE Voucher Store and redeemed at checkout.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: Make sure that your payment method is valid at the time of the transaction, as the system will not process expired or invalid cards.</p>

<h2 id="paying-with-a-voucher">Paying with a voucher</h2>
<p>When you schedule your exam, select Exam Voucher as your form of payment.
For expired vouchers and other voucher issues, please contact <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.pearsonvue.com/us/en/microsoft.html#contact">Pearson VUE Customer Service</a></p>

<h2 id="test-receipts">Test receipts</h2>
<p>After payment is successfully processed, you will receive a confirmation email from Pearson VUE. This email will include the payment receipt, confirming the transaction. You can also access your test receipt by logging into your Pearson VUE account.</p>
<p>For any discrepancies in your receipt, please contact Pearson VUE Customer Service.</p>

<h2 id="refunds">Refunds</h2>
<p>Refunds are provided based on when the cancellation is made:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>More than 30 days before the appointment:</strong> Full refund.</li>
  <li><strong>Between 48 hours to 30 days before the appointment:</strong> Partial refund.</li>
  <li><strong>Less than 48 hours before the appointment:</strong> No refund is available.</li>
</ul>
<p>Refunds are generally issued to the original payment method used at the time of purchase.</p>

<h2 id="where-is-my-refund">Where is my refund?</h2>
<p>Refunds typically take <strong>3-10 business days</strong> to process. However, the exact timeline may vary depending on your bank or payment provider. If you do not see your refund after 10 business days, contact <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.pearsonvue.com/us/en/microsoft.html#contact">Pearson VUE Customer Service</a> for further assistance.</p>
