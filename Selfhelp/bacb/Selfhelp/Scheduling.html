<h2 id="rescheduling-and-canceling-with-accommodations">Rescheduling and Canceling with Accommodations</h2>
<p>If your exam includes special accommodations, the rescheduling and canceling process may differ slightly.</p>

<p><strong>Rescheduling:</strong> You may only reschedule your exam <strong>after</strong> your accommodation request has been approved by BACB. Once the accommodation is approved, you can reschedule by contacting Pearson VUE Customer Service or using the Pearson VUE website. Be sure to allow at least <strong>48 hours</strong> before your appointment for any changes to be processed.</p>
<ul>
  <li>More than 30 days before the appointment: No fee.</li>
  <li>Between 5 to 30 days before the appointment: A rescheduling fee applies:
    <ul>
      <li>1.5-hour exam: $27.00.</li>

    </ul>
  </li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Canceling:</strong> Similar to standard canceling procedures, but if accommodations have been arranged, you should ensure that you cancel in time for those accommodations to be adjusted. Canceling must also be done at least <strong>48 hours</strong> before the appointment.</p>

  </li>
  <li>Less than 48 hours: Exams cannot be canceled.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the event of an emergency within 48 hours of your appointment, contact BACB directly for support.</p>

<h2 id="what-if-im-past-the-deadline-to-reschedule-or-cancel-my-test">What if I'm Past the Deadline to Reschedule or Cancel My Test?</h2>
<p>If you miss the 48-hour deadline to reschedule or cancel your test, your exam will be marked as a "no-show," and you will lose your exam fee. To take the test, you will need to purchase the exam again and schedule a new appointment. In emergencies, contact BACB for assistance through their <strong>Administrative Appeals</strong> page.</p>

<h2 id="change-test-delivery-test-center">Change Test Delivery (Test Center)</h2>
<p>BACB exams are only administered at Pearson VUE test centers, as online testing is not available. To change your test center location, you must cancel your current appointment and schedule a new one using the Pearson VUE website or Customer Service.</p>

<h2 id="change-test-language">Change Test Language</h2>
<p>If you need to change the language in which you take the exam, you must cancel your current appointment and schedule a new one with the desired language through the Pearson VUE website or Customer Service.</p>

<h2 id="retaking-a-test">Retaking a Test</h2>
<p>If you need to retake the exam, you must contact BACB to reapply. BACB will then send a new Authorization to Test (ATT) email to you, allowing you to schedule a new exam through Pearson VUE. Keep in mind, you cannot retake an exam you have already passed unless your certification has expired.</p>
