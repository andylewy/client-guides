    <h2>Scheduling a Test</h2>
    <p>To schedule a BACB exam, you must submit a certification application to the BACB and receive an Approval Notice. Once you receive the notice, you can schedule and pay for the exam through the Pearson VUE website or by contacting the Pearson VUE Customer Service Call Center. Note that BACB does not use OnVUE, and walk-in appointments are not allowed.</p>
    <p>You must be at least 18 years old to take a BACB exam.</p>

<section id="past-deadline">
    <h2>What if I'm Past the Deadline to Reschedule or Cancel My Test?</h2>
    <p>If you do not reschedule or cancel your exam at least 48 hours before the appointment, it will be marked as a "no-show," and you will lose the exam fee. You must schedule a new exam and pay the fee again. For emergencies within 48 hours, you should contact BACB directly.</p>

<section id="change-delivery">
    <h2>Change Test Delivery (Test Center)</h2>
    <p>BACB exams are only delivered at test centers; online testing (OnVUE) is not available. To change the test center location, you must cancel your original appointment and schedule a new one through the Pearson VUE website or Customer Service Call Center.</p>
</section>
<section id="change-language">
    <h2>Change Test Language</h2>
    <p>If you need to change the exam language, cancel your existing appointment and schedule a new one with the desired language through the Pearson VUE website or Customer Service.</p>
</section>
<section id="retaking">
    <h2>Retaking a Test</h2>
    <p>If you need to retake the exam, you must contact BACB to reapply. BACB will then send a new authorization record to Pearson VUE and provide another Approval Notice to you, which you can use to schedule a new exam appointment. You cannot retake an exam you have already passed unless your certification has expired.</p>
